Trello was used to track what tasks I was working on and what I needed to do next.

#### Balsamiq

Balsamiq was used to wireframe and plan how I wanted to structure my website.

## Pain Points
One of the biggest struggles for me was filtering when to display the add to Group button on the games index page. It had to check if the current user is an Admin in a group and that said group doesn't already have that game.
